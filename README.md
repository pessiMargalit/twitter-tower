# Twitter Tower Project

Twitter aims to expand its business into the construction and real estate market. This program assists Twitter in researching different types of towers by allowing users to choose between rectangular and triangular towers.

## Usage

1. **Rectangular Tower**: Select this option to calculate the area or perimeter of a rectangular tower.

2. **Triangular Tower**: Choose this option to perform calculations or print a triangular tower.

3. **Exit**: Select this option to exit the program.

## Rectangular Tower

For a rectangular tower, you will be prompted to provide the length and width of the tower. The program will then determine whether it is a square or a rectangle based on the difference between the lengths of the sides. If the difference is greater than 5, the program will calculate and print the area. Otherwise, it will print the perimeter.

Example:
```
Tower height must be greater than or equal to 2.
Please enter the width of the rectangular tower: 4
Please enter the height of the rectangular tower: 8

Area of the rectangular tower: 32
```

## Triangular Tower

For a triangular tower, you have two options:

1. **Triangular Perimeter Calculation**: This option calculates and prints the perimeter to a triangle calculation.
2. **Printing the Triangle**: This option prints a triangular pattern based on the width and height provided by the user.

Example:
```
Please select an option:
1. Triangular Calculation
2. Printing the Triangle
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 2
Please enter the width of the triangle: 5
Please enter the height of the triangle: 4

Printing the triangle:
  *
 ***
 ***
*****
``` 

If the width of the triangle is an even number or if it's longer than 2 times its height, the program will display a message indicating that the triangle cannot be printed.
